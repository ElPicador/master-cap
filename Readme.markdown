# What is it ?

Here are [capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki) extensions to be used with [master-chef](https://github.com/octo-technology/master-chef)

# How to use it

* Add ``master-cap`` to your Gemfile
* Load ``master-cap`` in your Capfile: ``require 'master-cap'``
* Choose a topology driver and load it
** ``on :load, :load_topology_directory``
** Create a subdirectory named ``topology``, and add your toplogy YAML files into
* Enjoy :)

# Topology file

Example of a topology file: ``integ.yml``

```yml
:topology:
  :app:
    :hostname: my_app_server.mydomain.net
    :type: linux_chef
    :roles:
      - app_server
  :db:
    :hostname: db_server.mydomain.net
    :type: linux_chef
    :roles:
      - db_server
  :redis:
    :hostname: redise.mydomain.net
    :type: linux_chef
    :roles:
      - redis_server
:cap_override:
  :my_specific_cap_param: 'toto'
:default_role_list:
  - base
```

# Capistrano commands

## Node selection

* ``cap integ show``
* ``cap app-integ show``
* ``cap integ_db_server show``

## SSH command

* ``cap integ check``: try to connect on each nodes with ssh
* ``cap integ ssh_cmd -s cmd=uname``: exec ``uname``command on each nodes

# Master-chef binding

## Configuration

If you use only master-chef (no custom repo with Chef recipes), you have nothing to do.

If you use a custom repo, please add following lines before requiring master-cap

```ruby
set :git_repos_manager_class, 'SimpleGitReposManager'

set :git_repos, [
  {
    :url => "http://github.com/octo-technology/master-chef.git",
    :ref => "aa597911b6d394dff27338c825aa966105cb6607",
  },
  {
    :url => "git@github.com:xxxx/yyyy.git",
    :local_path => "../yyyy",
  }
]
```

Note:
* ``:ref`` is used to lock master-chef version
* ``:local_path`` is used to run ``chef:local``

# Cap commands

* ``cap integ chef``: run chef on all servers
* ``cap app-integ chef:local``: run chef on app server, using local recipes. Usefull for debugging.
* ``cap app-integ chef:generate_local_json``: generate the ``local.json`` file using current topology.
* ``cap app-integ chef:stack``: output last chef stack trace
* ``cap integ chef:stack``: purge all master-chef git repos caches
